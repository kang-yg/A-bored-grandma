It is an application for a grandmother or grandpa who uses a smartphone but is difficult to use or difficult to type.
v1.0.0 has 3 functions as representative.
1. You can move to YouTube and KakaoTalk through the application.
2. It is possible to move to a YouTube search without the need of typing.
3. Tells you how to get home from your current location by walking / public transit / by car. (I used the URL SCHEMA on the map of Cacao.)
